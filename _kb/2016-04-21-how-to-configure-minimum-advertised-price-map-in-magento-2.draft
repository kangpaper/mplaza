In the business, it is intelligibility when the merchants are not allowed to give a lower price than that the manufacturer offer. However, with Minimum Advertised Price from Magento, not only you can continue to comply with the producerâ€™s needs but you also have a chance to publish the greater price to your clients. Awaring that the requests are different by many producers, but it is possible for you to set the appearance of your real price on the pages which are not banned by the producers.

## MAP Logic

Depending on the price of the product to apply the relevant MAP Logic.
* For the price that is set by multiple options,
  * MAP is assigned to the main price while the price of options, bundle items or related items still appear as normal.
  * If the main price is not available, MAP is the price of the related product that maybe in a grouped product. 
  * If a product is in the cart where appears the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, MAP is not deleted.
* For other price configuration,
  * If a tier pricing is set, the tier price appears according to the Display Actual Price setting. 
  * If a special price is set, it is considered to be the actual price for MAP. 

In the order and customer management tools and the reports sections, only the actual price is allowed to present.
