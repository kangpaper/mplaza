If you donâ€™t want anyone to use your original product image that you have already published, set the image watermarks for each image to identify them as yours. Many types of image are supported here as .jpg (jpeg), .gif, or .png image. An example for the image watermark settings:

* Size: 200x300 
* Opacity: 40
* Position: Stretch
