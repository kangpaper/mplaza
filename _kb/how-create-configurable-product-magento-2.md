You can create a Configurable Product in Magento 2 through many variations and the Configurable Product differs from a Single product by a drop-down list of option for each variation. That means it is simple for you to track inventory for the product variation because an option is actually a simple product with a unique SKU. This advance is the thing you could have if creating a simple product with custom options, however,  it is impossible to track inventory for each variation by that way. Although it take much time to set up a configurable product, you can save time in the long term of your business’s growing. Therefore, the configurable product type is a good choice for products with multiple options.

# Part 1: Create the Configurable Product

## Step 1: `Select the Product Type is Configurable Product`

* On the Admin sidebar, click `Products`. Then under `Inventory`, select `Catalog`
* In the upper-right corner on the `Add Product` menu, select `Configurable Product`

## Step 2: `Select the Product Template`

To choose Product Template, you can follow one of two ways: 
* Enter directly the name of the template that you want to choose in the `Search` box
* Click in the list and choose the template that you want to use.
Remember that, a Configurable Product require the option of available fields must include at least one drop-down attribute.

## Step 3: `Complete the Required Fields`

* In the `Product Details` section, enter the product `Name`.
* Either accept the default `SKU` that is based on the product name, or enter another value.
* Enter the product `Price`.
* If necessary, change the `Tax Class`. The default setting is “Taxable Goods.”
* Because the product is not yet ready to publish in your catalog, set the `Product Online` switch to the “Off” position.

## Step 4: `Complete the Remaining Product Details`

* (Optional) You can add an image that represents the configurable product as a whole, or wait until later when you set up the configurations. In this example, we use an image that shows the top in all three colors. An image uploaded here becomes the image of the “parent product.”
  * Drag an image from your desktop, and drop it on the camera tile in the `Images and Videos` box.
  * In the box, click the `camera tile`, and navigate to the image file on your computer. Then, select the image, and click `Open`.
A placeholder appears until an image is uploaded. If you prefer, you can later add video to the gallery.
* The `Quantity` field is not available because it’s determined by each product variation.
* To assign the product to a `Category`, do one of the following:
  * Start typing to find a match. Then, choose the`Category`.
  * Click the `Show List` icon to view the `Category` tree. Then, drill down through the available categories, and tap each category that you want to assign to the product.
  * Click `New Category`. Enter the `Category Name` and choose the `Parent Category` to determine its position in the menu structure. Then, click `Create Category`.
* Enter the product `Description` directly into the text box, and format as needed. Then, click `Submit`. You can also use the `WYSIWYG Editor`for additional control.

## Step 5: `Save and Continue`

This is a good time to save your work. In the next step, you’ll set up the configurations for each variation of the product.
* In the upper-right corner, click `Save`.
* Continue with `Adding Configurations`.
