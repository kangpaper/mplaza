For a specific customer group, you can set a discounted price if the members log in to their account. The special offer will appear in the shopping cart when they checkout at your store instead of the regular price.

## Set up a group price

* Open the product in edit mode
* In the basic product settings, `Advanced Settings > Advanced Pricing`.
